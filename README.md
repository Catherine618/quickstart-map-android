quickstart-map-android
==================

A library, sample app and starter template for getting started with Esri's Android Runtime SDK.

See the repo's wiki for additional details: https://github.com/Esri/quickstart-map-android/wiki

![App](https://raw.github.com/Esri/quickstart-map-android/master/quickstart-android.png)

## Features
* Simplifies common coding patterns down to one or a couple of lines of code
* Goes beyond the SDK samples in demonstrating best practices for building mapping applications on Android.
* Includes EsriQuickStart library project, fully functional sample app, and a Hello World template app that you can quickly build upon.
* As of Version 1.1 the library project and associated jar file contain the Javadoc.

## Instructions

1. Make sure you have installed both the [Google Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) and the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/android-sdk/concepts/0119/01190000002m000000.htm). I have tested this with the ADT Bundle if that is the easiest way for you to go.
2. Download and unzip the .zip file or clone the repo.
3. Create new project or import into Eclipse.
4. For the EsriQuickStart project, right click on the project name in the Package Explorer > Properties > Android > Library > Check the "Is Library" option > OK. Once that is done clean your project.
5. To add the javadoc so that you get access to the code comments via intellisense right click on the EsriQuickStart library project name in the Package Explorer > Properties > Java Build Path > Source > Add Folder > [Select the directory where the javadoc is] > OK. Once that is done clean your project.
